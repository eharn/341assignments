Please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
https://github.com/eharn/341assignments

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. 
Localhost connection - server connection on port 3000
successfull route on / and users
creates new user using submit and Post method upon send click
route and parse new user name and send it to the console

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
I'm not sure exactly what or if nodemon is working?!

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
It was really cool to see how everything loops through and works together. Seeing the new user name write out to the 
console through the terminal was the coolest part. I've never been great with terminal work so it was neat to 
see something start to click as I was working between my editor and my terminal.

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
I think just the robustness of the assignment was fairly overwhelming as I started working from what seemed like scratch.
The video in connection with the written assignement could have been better formulated. I started and worked through the 
written assignment before I did the videos and that was a grave mistake. I wish I would have known that sooner.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment: 4
 
   4 - Meets requirements
 

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I worked for hours to get this figured and worked with my group. Each element required is working, but 
I didn't go above and beyond. Nothing much added to make it really exciting.
