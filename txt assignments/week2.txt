1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application (e.g., Heroku):

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
https://github.com/eharn/lofty-cse341
3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. 
This week there are quite a few sections to get the small program to work. 
app.js spins up the server, then ta02.ejs and ta02.js get the javascript attatched to the 
program to create actions in the localhost.
4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
The stretch goals don't work yet. We worked on some ideas to get them to work, but went ahead and
stepped them back to be sure my base code still worked. So it still just removes the first name
on the list.
5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
Seeing how node takes variables was my favorite part. It's similar to php in a way and I like
seeing all the ways to make a program dynamic.
6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
Just personal study. I'd try to go a little deeper before getting together with my group. It's so
hard to get all the huge videos done before meeting and working.
7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:

   4 - Meets requirements


8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I made sure to work until I met requirements, as long as it took.
